# Intro to AI (Updating)

Rutgers CS440 is actually strongly referenced from [Berkeley CS188](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp24/), for Syllabus, PPT and Assignments. So here, I will give a common note (but mainly focus on Rutgers CS440) and highlight their difference. And for assignments, I will give the code for Rutgers CS440 after 24fall term.
