# Introduction to AI (Updating)

Rutgers CS440 is actually strongly referenced from Berkeley CS188, for Syllabus, PPT and Assignments. So here, I will give a common note (but mainly focus on Berkeley CS188) and highlight their difference. And for assignments, I will give the code for Rutgers CS440 after 24fall term.

## Note
