# Game Theory
## Chapter 1 Game Theory Intro
### Self-interested Agents and Utility Theory
An agent is **self-interested** mean that agent has its own description of states of the world. And each such agent has  a utility function which represents their potential responses for the impact of uncertainty.
### Defining Games
The **Players** of the Game are decision makers. And the **Actions** in the Game are things that players can do.
There are two standard representations of Games:
- Normal Form, which lists what payoffs get as a function of their actions.
- Extensive Form, which includes timing of moves.
#### The Normal Form
Assuming we have $n$-person normal form: $<N,A,u>$:
- Players: $N = \{1,...,n\}$ is a finite set, indexed by $i$
- Actions for player is $A_i$, and the action profile is $a=(a_1,a_2,...,a_n) \in A=A_1\times...\times A_n$.
- Utility function for player $i$: $u_i: A\to R$. And $u=(u_1,...,u_n)$ is a profile of utility functions.
#### The Standard Matrix Representation
We could write a 2-player game as a matrix: "row" player is player 1, and "column" player is player  2.
### Kinds of Games
#### Pure Competition Games
In pure competition games, for all action profile, the sum of payoffs is a constant number. Special case: zero sum.
#### Cooperation Games
Players have exactly the same interests. There is no conflict: all players want the same things. And they always get the sam payoffs
#### General Games
The most interesting games combine elements of **cooperation** and **competition**. The sum of the payoffs are always positive and players will never get "fail". They just competite for limited payoffs.
